    "Q2. Differentiate between Abstraction and Encapsulation. Explain with an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Abstraction is a method which helps to hide the unwanted data from the user where implementation details will be hidden only function details will be available to the user end, while data encapsulation is a method which helps to hide data using a single entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "example--- lets take an example of interaction between a user and a mobile phone. Encapsulation is a technique for \"information concealment,\" so you don't \"need to know the inside workings of the mobile phone to operate\" it. The encapsulation ensures that the internal components are protected and accessed only through well-defined interfaces or methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "where, let's consider the concept of abstraction in the context of a car. When you drive a car, you are not concerned about the intricate details of how the engine works, how the transmission shifts gears, or how the suspension system operates. Instead, you interact with the car through a high-level interface or abstraction. You use the steering wheel to control the direction, the pedals to control the speed, and various switches and controls to operate lights, wipers, and other features. Abstraction focuses on providing a simplified and high-level interface to interact with an object or system, hiding unnecessary complexities."
