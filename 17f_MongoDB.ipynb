    "-MongoDB is a popular open-source NoSQL (non-relational) database that provides a flexible and scalable approach to storing and managing data.       \n",
    "-MongoDB stores data in flexible JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas.     \n",

    "*Non-relational databases are designed to handle large volumes of data, high write loads, and unstructured or semi-structured data. It offers,\n",

    "2. High Scalability\n",
    "3. High Performance\n",
    "4. Handles Unstructured Data\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*MongoDB can be used by businesses and organizations of all sizes who are looking to scale out huge volumes of traffic as well as data. MongoDB can be used if you desire great speed and certain flexibility with the use of unstructured data within a schemaless environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "*SQL Database is more suited for businesses and industries that deal with structured and Relational data. It is great for websites with high traffic and facilitates a high-performing query engine. Data insertions, specialized web functions, quick processing, and robust reliability are some of the best features offered by SQL Databases. "

    "\n",
    "2. Indexing--You can index any field in a document.\n",
    "\n",

    "4. Duplication of data--MongoDB can run over multiple servers. The data is duplicated to keep the system up and also keep its running condition in case of hardware failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Load balancing--It has an automatic load balancing configuration because of data placed in shards.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Supports map reduce and aggregation tools.\n",
    "7. Provides high performance.\n",
    "8. Stores files of any size easily without complicating your stack.\n",
